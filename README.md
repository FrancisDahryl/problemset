## Library

* `RandStream` - extends `stream.Readable`. Generates a stream of random characters from the following character set:
```
0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.
```

### Stream

Create a class called `RandStringSource` which accepts an instance of the class `RandStream`. `RandStringSource` should be a subclass of `events.EventEmitter`.

Given the stream of random characters generated by `RandStream`, `RandStringSource` should emit an event `data` whenever a string enclosed by `.` is  detected. The enclosed string should be used as payload in the `data` event.

#### Example Usage
```js
let source = new RandStringSource(new RandStream());

source.on('data', (data) => {
  console.log(data);
})
```
